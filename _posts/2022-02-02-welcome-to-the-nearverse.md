NEAR Protocol is a layer-one blockchain that aims to solve the problems of slow transaction rates, limited throughput, and poor compatibility. The NEAR Protocol is a decentralized application platform that can revolutionize systems, develop applications and change how users utilize the web in general.

## How Does NEAR Work?

NEAR is a community-run cloud infrastructure for the deployment and operation of decentralized applications. It offers the characteristics of both a decentralized database and a serverless computation platform. The token that allows this platform to function also allows apps built on top of it to interact in novel ways.

It's a complicated technology with a singular objective which is to make it easy for engineers and innovators to create products that safeguard high-value assets like money and identity while also being performant and useful for users.

NEAR is designed from the bottom up to give end-users with simple interactions, scale capacity over millions of devices, and enable developers with new and sustainable monetization models for their apps. As a result, NEAR is constructing the world's first community-run cloud capable of increasing the breadth of Open Finance and ensuring the future of the Open Web.

It is a blockchain-based decentralized application platform that is arranged to be permissionless, highly functional, and safe enough to produce a powerful and decentralized data layer for the future web, and it operates on hundreds of servers globally.

NEAR is fundamentally a platform for hosting apps that have access to a shared and secure pool of money, identity, and data that their users control. In terms of technology, it integrates partition-resistant networking, serverless computation, and distributed storage into a novel system.
